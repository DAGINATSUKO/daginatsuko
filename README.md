### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

IT professional, web developer, computer hardware enthusiast and VR fanatic living in the United States working as a systems administrator. My hobbies revolve around building computers, aerial photography, automotive and web development.

My goal is to build a refined knowledge of how both hardware and software can come together to create unique experiences that push the very boundaries of how we perceive modern technology.
